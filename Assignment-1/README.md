# CS60075-Assignment-1

## PreSetup for running any notebook :
```
- Install/Upgrade to gensim 4.2.0
- Create a data folder with train.txt and test.txt inside the folder in which the notebooks are present to be able to run the code.
```

## Information about the files

- CS60075_Asgn1_P1.ipynb
```
Contains the implementation of n-gram language model 
```

- CS60075_Asgn1_P2.ipynb
```
Contains the implementation of Neural network based language model 

Note: I have run the code in my local system in which the version of gensim which is used to load the word2vec model, is gensim-4.2.0 (gensim-3.6.0 was present in google colab python environment). So if you are using it on google colab, you have to upgrade the version of gensim first before running, otherwise some argument errors may appear.
```

- Asgn-1-Report.pdf
```
Contains the report about the observations and results of the two models.
```

## Special Note: 
- I have run both the files on my local system using my Nvidia-GPU and local conda environment
